Work in progress.. Read a .hash file from USB then Authentication for a file specified.. has to pass USB sha256 hashed password and Volume ID for USB.. This gives you 2 factor authentication for a specified folder (SECURE_FILE_PATH).. What I am trying to do is create a system that only authenticates based on access of USB stick, so, in other words know one can access the files in the folder outside of USB access..
